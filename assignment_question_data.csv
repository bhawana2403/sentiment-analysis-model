102,@vamsi7 Thanks! it was certainly helpful! cheers.,Positive
103,"@diana-0 Hi, could I seek clarification on the following as well: 1. How long will the debt collection exercise go on for? For example, if only 50% is recovered, will the remainder be collected at a later date or be written off?  2. If an issuer defaults, does it have legal obligation to pay off the FS debt if and when it generates revenue? 3. For issuers who default, and who are subsidiaries/held by other companies (e.g. Listed companies) or have directors with free cash flow, are they obligated to 'bail' out the issuer?  4. Does FS invest in ALL issuers listed on FS? If yes, is there a minimum amount and is it done via the FS platform (i.e. FS's investment counts towards funding goal)? Would FS then pursue to recover the monies in the event of a default?",Neutral
104,"Just for illustration purposes, i have received around $1750 in principal, $90 in interest (including late fees) and have been charged $13 in fees.   That's around 12 to 14% in fees effectively. Which is quite high considering the possible risk of losing your capital if an issuer defaults.",Negative
107,"3. How will you ""request"" the funds from them? Can legal action be taken to force them to pay up or declare bankruptcy?",Neutral
108,"What happens to the interest earned from the Trust Account? Is that a ""profit"" of the Escrow Agent (Malaysian Trustees Berhad) or Funding Societies?",Neutral
109,"@frank70 IMO while the 15% fee brought down the return from 10.8% p.a. to 9.18% p.a., it's still quite an attractive investment especially when it's only 30 days so there's much less uncertainty.",Positive
110,I noticed that Funding Societies / Modalku has yet to disburse the loans even though they have been Fully Funded.   Is there a specific reason for this?   I don't see why you should be waiting to disburse the loans if you've receive 100% of funding from Investors?,Negative
111,"In the Investment Repayments & Loan Details, what the 'Terms' represent? The number of payments throughout the entire loan period (e.g. 12 terms for a 1 year loan is monthly repayment)?  In the future, could the Investment Repayments also show when future payments are due? Better yet, each icon (on time, late etc.) could show details like amount or remarks when hovered over?   This would be great in the absence of a statement (that shows info like whose funds have been received, or which issuers' payments are due this month) as it's quite difficult to keep track using just the Loan Portfolio aggregated figures.  Thank you!",Neutral
116,"@jlhc Based on the posts here http://forum.letscrowdsmarter.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=43 (regarding late payments by a Singapore issuer), FS issued a Letter of Demand to the Director/ Personal Guarantor. When that failed, a writ of summon was issued, the costs of which were borned by investors who voluntarily contributed to it.  I wonder if repayment can be demanded from their parent / holding / sister companies. Otherwise, it doesn't really matter whether the issuer is a subsidiary of a listed or blue-chip company.",Neutral
117,"Does the invoice serve as 'collateral, and will the issuer's customer pay FS directly when the invoice is due (as opposed to paying the issuer)?  And in the event of a default, who would action be taken against (i.e. who is responsible to make repayment)?  Thank you.",Neutral

143,"What I find daunting is that P2P is not secured, as in I could lose my invested capital. Do other people feel this way?",Negative
147,"To me, yes, it's less risky, because invoice financing is ""secured"" by the invoice underlying the deal. Term loans on the other hand, are unsecured so the level of recourse you get is obviously lower.  That being said, as yscenteno mentioned, there are 2 types of invoice financing; one, where the buyer is liable to pay the financier directly (i.e. notified basis), and one, where the buyer pays the seller/SME before paying the financier (i.e. non-notified basis).  Invoices financed on a notified basis are more ""secured"" vis-a-vis those financed on a non-notified basis - since, (a) the buyer is aware of this arrangement and (b) payment is made directly to the financier. This difference in risk level is reflected in the interest rates on the market as well - interest rates for those financed on a notified basis is slightly lower than those on a non-notified basis, since it's slightly less risky.  TL;DR : Yes, less risky, but difference in risk levels depend on whether it's financed on a notified / non-notified basis :)",Neutral

Today, the former has joined the first world club, whereas we ... well, we are entangled in some middle-income web.  Returning to the topic at hand, the money I transfered from M'sia successfully reached FS S'pore. These are the costs:  * **Exchange rate cost** is about 1.5% of the money transfered. So, if you transfer SDG 1,000, you'd pay approx.

586,"### 7 things to know about Funding Societies before you invest  *Investor: ‘I want higher returns from my investment.’ Businessman: ‘I need immediate cash to run my businesses.’*  As I write, there is a new and vibrant platform that acts as a marketplace to connect SMEs that require financing and investors who are seeking for high yielding investment vehicles in Malaysia. The platform is commonly known as peer-to-peer (P2P) financing.  In 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) has announced the P2P financing’s regulatory framework and has approved six P2P operators in Malaysia. One of them is Funding Societies. Personally, I’ve explored its facilities, registered an account and began investing. Thus, I’ll be sharing my personal experience and what I know thus far about investing via Funding Societies.  Therefore, here are the seven things you need to know about Funding Societies before you invest.  #### 1: What’s Funding Societies?  Funding Societies was launched in February 2017 as the first P2P operator in Malaysia. Presently, it is also the largest P2P operator in our nation. Since its launch, Funding Societies has crowdfunded RM 310.8 million regionally (Malaysia, Singapore an Indonesia). For local SMEs in Malaysia as of December 2017, they had successfully funded RM18 million so far.  #### 2: What can Investors buy?  Investors can choose to invest in both or anyone of the two:  * Business Term Financing * Invoice Financing  Business Term Financing allows investors to provide financing to SMEs for the purposes of working capital and capital expenditures over a short period of time. The duration ranges between 1 to 24 months. In return, the investors would profit from receiving interest payments from the respective SMEs.  Invoice Financing allows investors to buy over future receivables or invoices of SMEs at a discount. SMEs would benefit as they receive instant cash from the investors. In return, investors would profit from receiving interest income from the respective SMEs.  #### 3: How Much am I making?  Here is one of my investments in Funding Societies:  ![0_1515471919067_afacc805-1c50-4360-9164-c9c0253129a4-image.png](/assets/uploads/files/1515471921103-afacc805-1c50-4360-9164-c9c0253129a4-image-resized.png)   The details are as followed:  * Investment (Principal) = RM 1,000. * Tenure = 12 months. * Simple Interest Rate per annum = 13% (before service fees) * Net Repayment = RM 1,107.44 (after service fee) * Net Interest Income = RM 107.44  **Expected Net Returns on Investment (ROI) = 10.74%**  Looking at the simple interest return of 10.74% might already be appealing, but the real effective compound return is way higher than that. If you’ve gone through one of my Time Value of Money webinars, you will be able to calculate the **effective annual rate which is 19.26%.**  However, there are risks involved. Let’s examine them.  #### 4: What is my Risk?  As I’m a financing provider (like a banker), I would face the risk of potential loan defaults and late payments. As at December 2017, Funding Societies has reported a default rate of 1.4%, which in my opinion is very good. This low default rate is based on the track record of their Singapore HQ. In their few months operation here in Malaysia, there is zero default so far.  **Creditworthiness** Funding Societies provide a scorecard-based assessment of the SME’s creditworthiness. It is based on its business model, its financials, the directors’ CTOS and CCRIS scores, and its repayment behaviours.  **Site Visits** In addition, Funding Societies may conduct site visits and interviews of directors of these SMEs to ensure that its portfolio of borrowers is of superior in quality.  Personally, I would screen through the potential borrowers by checking out their fact sheets before investing in them. The fact sheet contains:  **The Financing Details** This includes the financing amount, simple interest rate, its purpose, documents obtained by Funding Societies and potential net returns from this investment.  **The Company’s Summary** This includes the date of incorporation, the company’s business nature, its paid-up capital, number of employees, existing debt exposures, its financing records and repayment behaviour.  **Directors’ Summary** This includes the duration of the directorship of a director in the company, his financing records and repayment behaviour, and any involvements in litigations.  **Financials** The audited financial accounts and its financial ratios.  In addition, I would also diversify my investments to a number of borrowers so that my risk is well-spread out.  #### 5: How Much can I invest?  First and foremost, you may need to deposit RM 1,000 into your brand new account. From which, you can start investing with as little as RM 100. The maximum amount is capped at RM 50,000 per investment.  #### 6: How do I track my Portfolio?  I’m able to track my investment portfolio with ease in my account.  The Summary:  *Portfolio Summary* ![0_1515472149489_0d686958-c9ec-4976-8c81-3c61854960cd-image.png](/assets/uploads/files/1515472151879-0d686958-c9ec-4976-8c81-3c61854960cd-image-resized.png)   *The Investment Details* ![0_1515472186064_8d19144f-97d1-48b0-9d51-ba005b701064-image.png](/assets/uploads/files/1515472186277-8d19144f-97d1-48b0-9d51-ba005b701064-image-resized.png)  *The Investment Repayment Schedule*  ![0_1515472221756_8c7cf085-bba3-495e-b39e-38cb21bc2254-image.png](/assets/uploads/files/1515472222257-8c7cf085-bba3-495e-b39e-38cb21bc2254-image-resized.png)   #### 7: How do I open my Account?

645,"@steven said in [Cross country investing with Funding Societies](/post/639): > what is advantage to invest in Singapore and Indonesia outside from home country?  Well, if you have extra cash to invest, then adding new locations could prove advantages. Else, you may find the effort tiresome.  1) In Malaysia, the min. investment amount is RM100. To achieve a decent diversification, one apparently needs to invest (according to folks who have researched P2P lending) in around 100 loans concurrently. Which means, we'd need up to RM10,000. But, since reinvestment is possible, we could lower the requirement to, say, RM7,000. (I haven't quite worked out the numbers here.) In Singapore, the min. investment amount is SGD 100 (approx. RM300), and in Indonesia, it is IDR 1 Juta (also, approx. RM300). So, to achieve proper diversification in these markets, one would need at least RM20,000 in each. We may, of course, treat FSMY, FSSG and MDK as one big market. Even so, we'd still need to set aside approx. RM 10,000 for each (i.e. RM30,000 in total).  2) In Malaysia, we still have some time to review a loan before it is fulfilled. Not so in Singapore and Indonesia. Too many investors compared to borrowers, particularly for short-term loans and invoice financing. So, to participate, you really need to trust the underwriters of FS and hope the auto-investing tool does the work for you. There is no guarantee that you'd get to invest in all the loans through. FS has in place some algo that selects investors, and determines how much of their funds would be used should there be excessive investors.  3) The Factsheets put together by FSSG are quite detailed and helpful. The Indonesian Factsheets are naturally in Bahasa Indonesia; so, unless your BM is pretty decent, they may very well sound gibberish to you. My point: there is a bit of a learning curve there.  4) MYR, having significantly declined in value in 2014, is finally appearing to climb out of the rut. If the current trend continues, it would wipe out whatever returns we get in the near future from our investments in Indonesia or S'pore.  Despite all these apparent disadvantages, I have opted to invest in these places because, I --  * am desirous of the diversification they offer; * enjoy the novelty of the investment experience; and * like the promised returns that are quite handsome (in Indonesia, at least).",Positive

If I'm interested, I would transfer the cash on the spot upon receiving the email. But everyone knows the balance would only be updated on the next working day. By the time the balance is updated the next working day, the financing has already been closed for bidding.  1. Back to the same topic again. It would be ideal to have a better real-time deposit system, instead of Bank Transfer + Verification system. This is too old school for a fintech like FS. Always be informed that it is on the way to have FPX or whatsoever, but no update until today.  2. Auto investment. This is only applicable to those who has much more cash on hand. Everyone knows that no interest could be earned in FS trustee account if not invested. Then, why would investors store so much money in FS trustee account whilst it is uncertain when would the next financing be?  So, I would suggest FS to implement the FPX system soonest possible for investors' convenience. And well understood Auto-investment method, but take note that it is not applicable to all investors.

659,"@yeow-foo-hwang said in [New Investment Opportunity: MBBT\-17120055](/post/658): >  tenor 1 month mean after 1 month only can get back the money invested and the return rate?  Yes, and no. 'Tenor' or 'term to maturity' of a loan (or bond) refers to the period of time remaining until the loan's maturity. So, you are right in saying that 1 month tenor would imply you'd get back your principal and interest in 1 month's time. However, this need not be the case for loans with longer tenor, say, of 12 months. Most of the term loans that FS offers requires borrowers to repay a certain percentage of the principal and interest monthly. So, you'll be getting your invested money throughout the tenor of the loan, and not merely at the end.  > then what mean effective interest rate?  Which is why we have simple and effective interest rates. The *simple interest rate* refers to the percentage of payment relative to principal paid by the borrower. Formula: **Simple Interest Rate = Total interest repaid / Principal**  The *effective interest rate*, OTOH, refers to **net present value of future cash returns divided by the principal**. And, since money received 1 month from now is more valuable than money received 1 year from now, the effective interest rate is significantly higher than its simpler counter part. To see this in action, you need to reinvest the monthly returns you get in other loans.  Hope the above clarifies.",Neutral

The credit assessment is done on both the SME and the directors, however the SME are the ones liable to repay the financing term.  Thanks for the answer!  It would also be helpful if you could provide additional info on the steps that FS has put in place to manage defaulting loans.  From the FAQ section, I understand that:   * As a precautionary measure, FS sends monthly reminders to issuers prior to the scheduled repayment date. * If an issuer missed a scheduled payment, it would enjoy a grace period of 7 days (not applicable for invoice financing), after which it would incur late interest charges in addition to the normal interest. * If the repayment is overdue by 90 days (60 days for invoice financing), the issuer would be considered to have defaulted on its commitment. FS would then work with the issuer to restructure the loan and setup a new repayment schedule. * If the issuer fails to improve, the case will be passed to a debt collection agency.  Now, my questions:  * **Late interest**: What is the late interest rate? Is it a fixed rate, or is it decided on a case by case basis? Will the issuer continue to incur late interest charges while the restructuring exercise is being carried out? * **Debt Collection Agency**: Is this a panel or just one agency? What is their track record? What are their charges -- would it be fixed commission, or would it be a percentage of the outstanding amount? What methods would the agency/agencies use? * **Legal Suit**: Should the matter be referred to the courts, who would lead it, would it be FS or the debt collection agency? And, should the matter be dragged until winding-up or bankruptcy proceedings, who would lead this? What would the role of investors be throughout this period?  Thank you, again.",Neutral

683,"All Factsheets put together by FS has a section called 'Financial Ratios', which lists a bunch of percentages over, typically, the last three years. If you are not sure what these are, just google for **financial ratio**, and you will be served with [almost half a million of results](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22financial+ratio%22).  I am familiar with these ratios, but decided to look them up anyway just to be sure. And, here are my take on seven of the items. (There are six others, which I'll cover separately, if I feel like doing so.)  1) **Revenue Growth** is the percentage increase of a company's sales compared to the previous year's sales performance. A negative value here implies reduction in sales. 2) **Gross Margin** is the ratio of a company's revenue minus *Cost of Sales* over the revenue. This typically shows how efficient a company is in producing the goods and services it sells, and also whether the company has an edge over its competition. *Cost of Sales* here typically refers to cost of labor, materials, and manufacturing overhead. 3) **Net Margin** is the ratio of the net profit over revenue. The profit is calculated by deducting overhead expenses, taxes and interest charges from gross profit. 4) **Current Ratio** is the ratio of current assets (cash, securities, inventory and receivables) over current liabilities (debt and accounts payable). It calculates how many ringgits in assets are likely to be converted to cash within a year to pay debts that are due in that year. This ratio gives a rough estimate of a company's financial health. A ratio below 100% indicates ill-health. 5) **Quick Ratio** measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its liquid assets (i.e. assets that could be converted to cash in 90 days). *Formula: Quick ratio = (cash + securities + receivable) / current liabilities*. A low quick ratio would indicate that a company has liquidity problems and has quite a bit of inventory idling in its warehouse. 6) **Leverage Ratio** is also known as debt to equity ratio, and is calculated by dividing total debt over total equity. Companies with low *Gross Margin* should seek to keep this ratio low. A ratio of 200% could be considered the high point. Anything above may indicate trouble. 7) **Gearing Ratio** indicates the amount of debt used by a company for its operations. The higher the ratio, higher are the probability of default and bankruptcy. This ratio is calculated by dividing all borrowed capital (i.e. long-term debt + short-term debt + bank overdraft) by shareholder equity. I'd be vary of companies with 100% or more gearing ratio.",Neutral

But, the majority of these notes have a tenor of 30 days or less. As a result, the IRR isn't that great -- even though 50% of the total invested amount has been returned!

958,"@alexanderang7 I think this is actually a brilliant idea and its workable, when there are many deals available. With many deals available, you are actually able to diversify into different deals to control the risk of default.   Say the default risk on FS is 2%, and your cost of financing is 3.88%, that makes your cost of financing up to 5.88% (assuming if you are able to invest into 100 different deals once you get the financing). With that, you are able to earn pure return of about 3-4%. The 3-4% seems small to alot people, but this is pure extra profit without using your existing capital. If you are able to get a loan of RM100k, you will get extra RM3k to 4k with minimal effort.  This is the power of leveraging. Of cause, it does come with risk. But if you are able to manage the risk well, in this case is to diversify and make sure that the platform is able to maintain its default rate.   Your idea actually enlighten me. If the Malaysia P2P is able to grow as big as those in US, whereby they actually group the deals together because of their funding is so big that, it doesn't make sense to offer deal by deal. They group those deals with similar risk and return together, for example Group A with Y% return for 100 deals. This actually make our life easier to diversify, and your idea would probably work best.",Neutral

As well as remember to pay on time, the fee & charges T&C from MBB clearly stated any late payment will result standard credit card agreement apply, which mean 18% p.a. of interest rate.  @Necrox you have correctly pointed out currently FS platform yet to build an unlimited supply of notes for us to mitigate the risk in order to diversiy.

First of all , you are paying 3.88% in advance for a 6 months term. That means the yearly rate is at least twice that. But there's more : you do not pay back as a lump sum at term's end , but in monthly installments , therefore the average term of your loan is just 3.5 months . meaning your APR is approx 3.88% /3.5 x 12 = 13.3%  So even if everything goes smoothly with FS , you are actually losing money. Also consider that when you deposit funds on FS account , it takes some time before you find a loan to invest  , and some other time before the loan actually starts , and during all this time (which might easily sum up to 1 month) your money isn't gaining any interest.  Anyway , in Singapore many people had your same idea with high yield bonds like Rickmers 8% , the bonds defaulted and they are now sleeping at the airport because they had to sell their houses to pay back the banks.

That is why I always encourage people to first establish the Financial Freedom Plan first, understand the concept of Financial Independent, then only move on Financial Planning, then only take action on Investment Vehicles following your Financial Plan. Eventually, it is not the Money we are going after, but the Whats behind the Money. Surround yourself with the teachers like financial coaches and mentors, these are few people you can start your Investment journey with:  1. First, you should meet Mr Wong Chai Soon (if your like Mandarin media) or Mr Yap Ming Hui (if you like English media), you can quote my name, they are personal friends of mine for more than decades. 2. Second, contact Mr KC Lau, he will open your eyes on all the Financial Opportunities in the market, but not too worry, as you already have Wong Chai Soon or Yap Ming Hui at your back, you already know what Investment Vehicles you should ride on, you won't be carried away with all the trends. (So note that the sequence who you should meet first is very very vital) 3. Move on contact Mr PC Wong, an expert in Foreign Share Investment, start to macro-diversify your investment in multiple currencies, now you have become a global investor. 4. After meeting these people, and you have tried and experienced, investment or speculate, move on to what you good at and what you believe in and you will meet more people that could help your investment in eg properties, local or foreign stock, forex, crypto, reits, unit trusts, p2p..etc  I can't emphasise more that the sequence of what you should learn first (who you should meet first) is very vital.

1250,"@chee-kin-lim   Hi   I was a loan banker for SME banking in one of the banks years ago.   What we see here is absolute numbers and it did not tell us too much from this breakdown.   What do I mean by this? At the first look 5 construction industry may have looked like a high number, however, if it is 5 out of 100, it will represent 5% of the borrower from the industry has a chance of default.   Again we look at 1 Art, Entertainment and Recreation on default mode, it may seem to be a small number. However if it is the only borrower from this industry, it will means that it has a 100% industry default rate.   For construction, it is a unique industry. Even in the bank, it has a high chance of late payment and default based on the definition.   Why is it so you may ask.   Unlike many industries, the construction company income is based on the stages of the project. They will need to hit certain milestones before they get paid by % based on the contract agreement.   Anything in between, the company will have to run on its own cash flow. They will have to pay the materials, the workers, the subcontractors before they complete the stages that could be verified for payment.   In between the stages, anything can happen, a subcontractor can go bankrupt without completing the work, bad weather and some unforeseen delays, hence, the cash flow will be tight resulting in any late or default payment.   Based on my banking days experience, all these cash flow problems will be ease once they had completed the stage and conditions for payment had been proven.   Personally, I am not very worried about construction sectors in Singapore due to the nature of operations. However, I could not say the same for other countries as I am not exposed to them.",Negative

When the director is declared bankrupty and is ordered by court to settle all the loans, the director might have already emptied all the assets but in fact all the assets are already not under his / her name. Hence, from a bank's perspective, they don't usually take personal guarantee for offering loans. And of course, when we talk about corporate loans, the loan amount offered by banks is much greater, that's why bank would definitely need some collaterals, securities or guarantees which are relatively more secure to the banks.",Neutral

Usually, we will talk to the directors to find out what is going on. Why are they facing problems? So long as they are cooperative and willing to negotiate, we are able to work something out together such as changing the payment schedules or tenor or etc.   By practice, we will only accept the personal guarantee for the small amount (Less than $100k, look big but it is small in the banking sector) and we will request for the other types of collaterals such as property if the facilities limits are high.  To be honest, for a small amount of 100k personal guarantee, it is not likely to bother the directors (Most are multi-millionaire) to transfer their assets. In my entire banking life, none of the personal guarantees had been activated before.   In the event that they are transferring their assets before the bankruptcy, the court could order the transfer to be voided if it is done within a certain time frame (Cannot remember how long).",Neutral

1353,"For investors who are more conservative and prudent, I believe this would be a good news for them as the loans are more secure.",Positive
1354,"@jitsheng   Thank you for reading my post.  This is a very safe way to lend money.  A loan is usually granted at around 85% max of a property value. So what it essentially means is that even if the property market is down by 5 or 10%, your loan is still fully secured by the property.   The tenor is not long at 12 months max which is not very long for secured loans   A 4% to 8% simple interest return is a decent return considering that it is a secured loan.  The property backed secured loans will help to balance your lending portfolio risks a little due to the reasons above.  In the event, the borrower become bankrupt and the assets need to be liquidated, high chance that you will get your full amount back as you have an early claim to the assets as a secured creditor.  On the flip side,   The minimum investment is $1,000 which is 20 times more than BTL and IF. For those investors with a low capital, the ability to diversify will be greatly reduced if you take up one PBSL.  While your portfolio risk is been lowered with this new form of loans, it will also means that your return will be lowered. It is a balance between risk and return.  Another interesting point I am not sure if anyone notice is that the loans will be in Monthly Interest payment (I) at every month and the bullet repayment of the principal at the end of the tenor (P+I). It is the same as IF. IF is short term so this is not an issue. However, for PBSL, you could be committing your capital up to 12 months to the loan before you could work on the capital again.   Some may like it as it does not require too much intervention from them in this period. For people like myself, I would prefer monthly repayment of Interest +Principal (P+I) so that I can reinvest my principals into new loans.  Everyone will have their view on this. Above is my view.   Right now, due to the fact that I do not have a huge capital, it is unlikely that I will attempt this.   In the future, if I am to attempt this, I will like to have a separate account or at least a separate section of the current account to invest in PBSL.  Lastly, my wishlist for FS on this will be as follow:  1. Work with MAS and the authority to open up the cap limit instead of keeping it at SGD 50k (Limit for non Accreditated investors?)  which means that 50 PBSL later, I could not deposit more to go ahead with more investment, thus losing the opportunities  2.

Thank you  As a Singapore FS user, the only concern is that the loan deal are snapped up too fast. Till the point where I login, it showed that the loan still did not start yet a few seconds later 99.9% had been filled up. It was that fast. I had been refreshing like crazy yet it keep showing not starting.   On your point of lesser company. I am currently quite comfortable with about 12 loans that I had been lending out. There are a couple I missed out, one or two i skipped cos I am not comfortable with overexposure with one client. The other couple of them I had skipped cos the minimum is too large amount.   I think I am still comfortable with the rate of lending. It may not seems to be too many in numbers but I think currently it is sufficient for me in view of my small amount of capital. With the default rate at less than 2%, I think FS had essentially cut down the work I will need to do.  Eventually, I will definitely go to other peer to peer such as Asset backed lending as well as Angel Funding into foreign and local establishment. For the later venture, the amount of committment needed could be as much as $250K per investor.",Neutral

It has a very good credit system, good deals that banks missed out as well as pretty swift responding team and a good interface programme for us to place our bid.   Increasingly from the last week, I notice that the system seems to be lagging whenever there is a loan. If one do several time refreshes during the time, the system keep showing that it is not open yet. But when it is finally done, the loan had been fully taken up. This is often the case in Singapore.  Noon today, there was suppose to be another loan, I login and wait about 2 minutes before using my phone and my laptop. When it is time, it lagged out completely. Even as I am refreshing now, it is still lagging me out.   I am a little disappointed by the lagging over the past few weeks as it created an unfair blockout on some users. I had been constantly updating my funds in anticipation for more deals ahead. At the rate it is going, perhaps my current funds are more than sufficient to handle the transactions here.   Despite of this, I will still like to make a few suggestions on how to improve the current system.   1. Scrap the auto bidding system  This is a cut throat world and to be honest, auto bidding system is not useful and will not be helpful for users who are actually actively waiting for the chance to bid on the loan. It rewards the passive and block out the chances for the active users. Not very healthy for the active bidders.  2. Instill a 5 minutes queuing system.   Instead of having an instant reaction bidding that will jam up the system. A 5 minute queuing system could be implemented. A person can login 5 minutes before the actual loan closing and make a bid. The successful bid come in first come first serve format so when the system open up the loan and close, the update can happen without lagging the bidding.   For your consideration.   (p.s. The FS still lagging at this instant as I am typing the post. I am not angry, just a little disappointed that I could not get loans due despite of my active actions and system went down.)",Negative

I do think that the current autoinvest method is fair but not efficient.  It gives priority to those who wasn’t given allocation previously. And will still leave a certain % for manual placements. The sad part is really there are too few loans to satisfy all investors.  In CM, the autoivest will give an allocation to everyone but it can become a very small amount (few dollars and cents).

If you got into the previous loan, the coming one you usually won't get. This is due to the round table allocation methods for everyone to take turns.

Its better for the company stays in operation and focus on improving their cash flow rather than fighting battles in court. That's a sure fire way to destroy relationships and bankrupting companies.

In business, integrity is more important than relationship, and in this note which I am referring to (not the one mentioned in the title) there is no late charges anyway.

2016,"@vamsi7   My concerns are as per below:   1. Every dollars invested = 1 points. Granted that there are more loans these days, there are times whereby there are not many loans to go around for investment. Hence there could be a case of ""I want to invest but there are not enough loans to go around.""  (Which is a reason why I only top up once or twice only to prevent the money to sit around.)  2. Will there be a case whereby I cannot maintain the tier status due to a lack of loans in that year? Or that will there be a case where I will be less strict on my own assessment of the borrowers to chip into their loans so that I will be less likely to lose my tier status?  3. Manual Queuing - Again this will reduce the chance of those who manually queue on their own for those who are not allocated. That could mean that those in the higher tiers have a distinct advantage in maintaining their tier.  4. Manual placement injection - Refer to the above.   5. Private placements - How does this work? Does it deny those in other tiers below more loans for them to rise in their tier?  6. Deposits within 2 business hours - I understand that FS want to make this a premium service but if FS do have the capabilities to do that,  it should be offer to more tiers instead of just the top tier.   7. Exclusive deals - I feel that this could be extended to more tiers. It will give them more motivations to invest with FS.

But any kind of rewards program is inherently designed to encourage people to take action, and is advantageous to people who support the company more, than the ones who support the company less. So its fair to give investors who support more SMEs in Funding Societies some benefits to make them feel valued. FS is not treating smaller tier investors any differently from before, they are just adding some benefits to the higher tiers. This is better compared to other kind of rewards programs where smaller tier users are ""punished"" to encourage them to go to higher tiers.",Positive

2394,"I got a replied from Malaysia Funding Societies:-  Auto Investment is a tool designed to enable pre-investment of a specific amount into investment notes that match each investor's pre-set parameter. Auto investment works according to its algorithm, which first runs through all filters to match investors' settings with investment notes. If an investment note matches the investor's settings, then a specific amount (which was set by the investor) will be pre-invested into the investment note. What happens if you are pre-invested into an investment note up to one hour before crowdfunding starts.  There are a few situations where investors' funds are not invested even if they have set Auto Investment, such as: *******1. Not enough Balance in investor account******* - If the investor's account balance is less than the amount specified in Auto Investment settings, then auto-investment cannot proceed.  ***2. Auto Investment settings do not match the investment note*** - If the investor's Auto Investment settings do not match the investment note (eg. financing tenor is not within the scope specified by the investor), auto-investment will not take place.  ***3. Matched all Auto Investment settings but investment is still not allocated*** - There is a possibility that an investor will not be auto-invested even if his Auto Investment settings match the investment note. Due to the algorithm of Auto Investment, investors who were auto-invested in the previous investment note will have lower auto-investment priority in the current investment note. If the pre-invested amount is oversubscribed, priority will be given to investors who missed out on auto-investment during the previous round.  ***4. What does it mean when the auto-invested amount isn't the same as the specified amount set by an investor?*** - There is a possibility that the auto-invested amount is smaller than the specified amount in Auto Investment. In the event that the pre-investment amount for Auto Investment is oversubscribed, the auto-bot will adjust your specific investment amount to allow more investors to participate. (eg. If you set the amount to RM1000 but the financing term is oversubscribed, your investment amount is pro-rated downwards depending on the number of investor subscribed to the financing term. Additionally, there is a possibility that some investors will be unable to participate in an investment note due to oversubscription, making the auto-bot unable to allocate for them.

If minimum investment is changed to 50, 100k loans can have maximum 2000 investors to manage, which translates to heavier workload to the platform. Bear in mind that the workload will be doublefolded every month because the staffs would need to update payments one by one into investors' account.  Based on my experience, payment update is considered quite slow currently. We usually expect to see payment update within 3 - 5 business days. So if this is implemented, perhaps we shouldn't blame the platform to take 10 business days to just update the payment for each loans. Does it make sense?  To me ultimately, the platform reserves the right to determine these terms, in which they deem appropriate. I think to me, RM100 or RM50 both are fine to me.",Neutral
2495,"@rajpuga I voted yes. I see it as a way to diversify more. I agree that its the platform's call, but I think they should keep investor's best interests in mind too.  @josephyiong i dont see how the 10 business days affect much in this case. if the difference between the repayment dates still says the same (15 days) then your funds are still being maturing the same way right?

2501,"@jonhan FYI, i voted yes, coz it isn't something very significant for me as an investor, but what I posted earlier was just a broader perspective / bigger picture. As for the longer period of time taken to update payments, I think that's a little unfair for investors. Remember the point of investing in P2P is that we earn by ""Reinvesting"" to generate compound interest. If it takes too long time to update the payment into investors' account, it means that we are unable to ""reinvest"" that quick enough. You got the point I'm trying to say?",Neutral
2515,"Hi Admin,  I have turned on the auto-invest but I will opt-out for certain crowdfunds based on the company's previous records. Sometime I will be auto opted-out for the crowdfund that I wish to invest but opted-in for crowdfund that I do not wish to invest. For the auto opted-out, the reason is loan amount is too small.  In order to be fair to every investor, I suggest FS only open the crowdfunding for manual investment for first hour then followed by auto investment afterward. For example, a crowdfund opportunity start at 4 pm, just allow manual investment for first hour. If the loan cannot fully funded at 5 pm, then auto investment will start to fill the balance until the loan is fully funded.  In my opinion, the people who spend more time and pay more effort to do manual investment should get higher priority to invest in a crowdfund.",Neutral

2646," I wonder why would FSMY hold investors' money for such a long time. This particular crowdfund was successfully funded on **18-Jul-2018** but the loan has only been disbursed on **01-Aug-2018**. To be fair to the platform, I calculate based on business days and it has taken **9 business days** (13 calendar days) for the fund to be disbursed. It's kinda unfair to investors because the fund is being held with 0% interest while noticeably the fund seems to be scheduled to be disbursed to the issuer on **1-Aug-2018** (Today). I'd asked this to the CS via livechat and below is the reply:  **Reply on 31-July-2018** *Thanks for reaching out.  We are pending for final agreements to be signed from the company director's end before providing them with the funds.  Hope this clarifies.*  My question is why would it be pending signature on 31-July-2018 afternoon but the fund to be disbursed on early morning before 9am on 1-Aug-2018? It seems to me a scheduled disbursement instead of the *excuse* given by the representative. FSMY, please provide transparent explanation.  Secondly, the interest keyed in is as below.

I personally am concerned here as an investor because this loan is an unsecured loan or subordinated loans.

Basically you do not have anything on hand in case of non-repayment which translates to loss of investor's principal. Even if the platform opts for legal actions and so forth against the guarantor, it will take looong time and still risking the principal.

So if this is implemented, perhaps we shouldn't blame the platform to take 10 business days to just update the payment for each loans. Does it make sense?  I highly doubt that the platforms are manually calculating and crediting each and every investor whenever they receive a repayment.   It wouldn't be difficult at all (and I will be surprised if this isn't already in place) for them to just key in the repayment amount plus the date as soon as they received the funds and their system should automatically calculate the total amount each investor should receive and credit it into the investor's account.",Neutral
2934,@jlhc hi there.. Perhaps you are right that payment updates and so forth are automated using high tech systems. Maybe FSMY can further clarify on this since only they know whether or not the workload will be increased when minimum investment amount is reduced. =),Neutral

2940,@josephyiong These are fairly low tech to be honest so I will be very disappointed if they are doing these manually.

Alternatively you can refinance the property yourself and loan the funds to your company to invest in Funding Societies, that may work.   However, do note that this will be a very risky venture as your investments in FS is not guaranteed and you may stand to lose everything if one or more borrowers default (FS Malaysia just *welcomed* their first defaulter recently).   Another thing to consider is how do you intend to spread out your risk. Say you refinance the property for RM200K, are you planning to dump the whole sum into a handful of borrowers? If you intend to spread out your eggs into many baskets (say RM1000 for each borrower), how long will it take for you to invest the whole RM200K?

3040,"@vamsi7 Cons: halfing the min amount means double the number of investors who may email platforms (especially for updates on late/default/etc for the respective individual notes), thus added costs/burden to manage such doubling of queries potentially leading to higher service fee in the long run.   Pros: easier for investors with limited funds to diversify. I remember in my statistics days on sampling, samples of 25 to 50 is a good number to reduce the std dev of samples and I assumed it would be the same for notes diversification. With limited funds of RM2,500 and @RM50 min amt, you can achieve pretty good diversification of 50 notes  Neutral: each platform have different strategies on min amounts. High min amount means higher standby platform funds (I believe FSSG once recommended to maintain S$3,000) as some platforms auto-allocation immediately upon announcement of note (like FS while other platforms give you time to top up prior to auto-allocation) i.e. it drives investors’ behaviour to maintain a higher standby platform funds to avoid losing out on auto-allocation. Such standby funds are also a form of revenue that platforms can earned(more likely at higher interest rate due to pooling of millions of dollars/ringgits). This is good (even at the expense of investors who earns no interest on such standby platform funds) because in the long run, the more the platform earns, the higher is its survival rate. While SG and MY is not like China, I am confident that a few will fail in the next 5 years as a good majority is losing money as they need series A/B/C/etc funding to ensure they are the dominant one in the future to churn at least hundreds of millions per annum in notes to stay profitable.

Also, learned a few hacks and created excel spreadsheets to track “behaviour” (for e.g. borrowers’ ID and invoice debtors’ ID, disbursement dates, repayment dates, etc is invaluable on certain platforms for me). Certain platforms/borrowers are also not angels (there are a few platforms who hold your committed funding for a few weeks  before the borrower accepts the loan, ie borrower is exploiting a loophole that they have obtained a line of credit, not unlike an overdraft and some platforms tolerate such behaviour, I seen one where a borrower cancelled and subsequently the platform refunded the committed amount without interest). Also certain platforms allow certain borrowers to borrow more to repay old loans/invoice financing and I even know 2 borrowers (some platforms do display borrowers’ name) who went to two platforms within a short period of time!  Honestly, the best investment I made so far is learning from YouTube and the internet. Trust me, never foray into risky endeavours without spending a few hours/days learning.

3404,"I have seen many discussions about how secondary markets (SM) should function on p2p platforms. The advantages for buyers are the ability to increase holdings when there are insufficient new loans available and for sellers to be able to realise funds without having to wait for loan maturity. The usefulness of an SM would depend on the type of loans being offered. For short term consumer loans around 30 days it would hardly be necessary, but for mid to long term loans for real estate or business it would be more useful. There are some other considerations. Firstly should the SM operate at par or offer premiums/discounts to the buyer. Secondly should sellers continue earning interest while their loans are on the SM or should the platform take this as a fee for running the SM or even charge a fixed fee to the seller. I also believe that the amortisation method used could make the operation of the SM very difficult. If interest is paid on the usual declining balance method both principal and interest vary with each monthly payment so how can they be easily apportioned between the old holders and the new? One platform I use, actually charges the borrowers this way but investors receive fixed principal each month and a reducing interest payment.

3405,"@alistair-black said in [Selling of loan parts](/post/3404): > I have seen many discussions about how secondary markets (SM) should function on p2p platforms. The advantages for buyers are the ability to increase holdings when there are insufficient new loans available and for sellers to be able to realise funds without having to wait for loan maturity. > The usefulness of an SM would depend on the type of loans being offered. For short term consumer loans around 30 days it would hardly be necessary, but for mid to long term loans for real estate or business it would be more useful. > There are some other considerations. Firstly should the SM operate at par or offer premiums/discounts to the buyer. Secondly should sellers continue earning interest while their loans are on the SM or should the platform take this as a fee for running the SM or even charge a fixed fee to the seller. > I also believe that the amortisation method used could make the operation of the SM very difficult. If interest is paid on the usual declining balance method both principal and interest vary with each monthly payment so how can they be easily apportioned between the old holders and the new?

I believe SM would be better suited for longer term loans, like property loans. if FS starts offering more types of loans with longer tenures, then that could be a right time for a SM.

It is a tussle to determine what is explicit vs implicit, non-positive vs non-negative, etc. As such to your question, unless it is stated in their term & conditions that they can show everyone their factsheets, they are not obligated to do so even if they did not tell you that they are not obligated, i.e the Singapore u-turn anology and thus it is for you to prove (in legal parlance) that why are they are obligated that “factsheet should be disclosed for investors not investing” and not the other way around.",Neutral

Yes , first step to put on a secondary market is to change the current ""fake"" amortization with the real one with installments showing actual capital and interest quotas. With current ""fake"" amortization the remaining principal is undervalued and therefore buyers would get a discount at sellers expense. Such an improvement would also show more correctly remaining loans principals and overall portfolio value",Neutral

I can't see the analogy with Lehman or generic securitization of loans , quite simply if an investor needs money and wants to cash in without waiting loans terms he can put them for sale , and if there is another investor who needs to invest funds and is tired of camping the deal is done with mutual benefit. Zero sum game , no leverage/securitization involved.",Neutral

3533,"@vamsi7 weill I too **love** inbox zero. But that applies mostly for adverts or spam. When it comes to my investments, I would like to know status via email, rather than logging into FSMY.  When I first joined, I found it quite uncertain if everything went as it should as there was no confirmation via email (which I personally felt should be a norm, but thats just me).  As of now, every information is via the FSMY webpage & app. Sure, we can go download manually, but how many actually do. And in the unlikely scenario where I needed to check some information, and the website or the app is being upgraded or is under maintenance I have no access to any of the information that I need. If I had option to receive all this information in my mailbox then I could retrieve all this information without the need to access the FSMY webpage or app.   In any case if you guys are thinking that this could be implemented and beneficial then there has to be **option to opt-in, or out**. For me I would like to know:  * notes I invested had been successfully funded. * notes that had concluded, with maybe a summary of performance or something. * maybe option to receive monthly statements via email (since it is already generated anyways).  I also agree with @Lipozami to have *option* to tone down CTF emails.

Also available is slection to display 5,10,20 or 50 loans.
