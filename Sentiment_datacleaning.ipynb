      "at_user said in  Leverage Bank  x s Money to Invest in FS  post  This came into my mind  I m a maybank account holder  They have this feature  Ezy Cash  to get advance cash bank in to your account directly and you can repay the amount over  months  They charge only  time fee  So example  I borrow RM  Bank charge me  of RM  RM  I will repay the bank RM  over  months  The RM  Now I have advance cash  and I use that RM k to invest in FS with  per year  I make a net of  using banks money  My risks of losing that RM k if the company of FS default payment  which is  Would you do it  no  First of all  you are paying  in advance for a  months term  That means the yearly rate is at least twice that  But there s more  you do not pay back as a lump sum at term s end  but in monthly installments  therefore the average term of your loan is just  months  meaning your APR is approx  x  So even if everything goes smoothly with FS  you are actually losing money  Also consider that when you deposit funds on FS account  it takes some time before you find a loan to invest  and some other time before the loan actually starts  and during all this time  which might easily sum up to  month  your money isn t gaining any interest  Anyway  in Singapore many people had your same idea with high yield bonds like Rickmers  the bonds defaulted and they are now sleeping at the airport because they had to sell their houses to pay back the banks  Do you have any comfortable airport in your area  \n",
      "well the story about the airport I read on sgtalk forum  and was actually about a woman who had rented out her apartment to make ends meet  but what s sure is that a lot of people were pushed by banks to buy two lots of such bonds  each one being  SGD  one being paid with investor money and the other with a bank loan  those who invested their life savings not only lost them all  but also found themselves with the same amount to pay back to the bank  if they sold home and went sleeping at the airport or jumped off balcony to get a faster solution is just speculation \n",
      "It is their choice  they decided to venture in it knowing the risk  when the issuer decided to take flight  they can best stomach the loss  Same here to TS or whoever thinking of using loan to invest in PP  Companies went bust not because of diminishing profits but bad cash flow  Same here  if a case like one of the issuer decided to pay later instead of the agreed tenure  suddenly you have a cash flow problem and may be detrimental to your financial health \n",

      "at_user Agree with you  Current state of bank transfer for depositing  means we have to carefully plan when to deposit the money based on repayments that are coming in  But I think the service fee is very less to affect your calculations  unless you are an angel investor ofcourse  \n",

      "at_user Hi I was a loan banker for SME banking in one of the banks years ago  What we see here is absolute numbers and it did not tell us too much from this breakdown  What do I mean by this  At the first look  construction industry may have looked like a high number  however  if it is  out of  it will represent  of the borrower from the industry has a chance of default  Again we look at  Art  Entertainment and Recreation on default mode  it may seem to be a small number  However if it is the only borrower from this industry  it will means that it has a  industry default rate  For construction  it is a unique industry  Even in the bank  it has a high chance of late payment and default based on the definition  Why is it so you may ask  Unlike many industries  the construction company income is based on the stages of the project  They will need to hit certain milestones before they get paid by  based on the contract agreement  Anything in between  the company will have to run on its own cash flow  They will have to pay the materials  the workers  the subcontractors before they complete the stages that could be verified for payment  In between the stages  anything can happen  a subcontractor can go bankrupt without completing the work  bad weather and some unforeseen delays  hence  the cash flow will be tight resulting in any late or default payment  Based on my banking days experience  all these cash flow problems will be ease once they had completed the stage and conditions for payment had been proven  Personally  I am not very worried about construction sectors in Singapore due to the nature of operations  However  I could not say the same for other countries as I am not exposed to them \n",

      "at_user Some loans are from those existing borrowers so it is not a good idea to blindly diversify like that  Or sometimes some loans with the same sectors come out at the same time so instead of diversifying you could end up going on the opposite direction \n",

      "When I first started out  FS was my first choice as a platform for me to take the plunge into the world of peer to peer  It has a very good credit system  good deals that banks missed out as well as pretty swift responding team and a good interface programme for us to place our bid  Increasingly from the last week  I notice that the system seems to be lagging whenever there is a loan  If one do several time refreshes during the time  the system keep showing that it is not open yet  But when it is finally done  the loan had been fully taken up  This is often the case in Singapore  Noon today  there was suppose to be another loan  I login and wait about  minutes before using my phone and my laptop  When it is time  it lagged out completely  Even as I am refreshing now  it is still lagging me out  I am a little disappointed by the lagging over the past few weeks as it created an unfair blockout on some users  I had been constantly updating my funds in anticipation for more deals ahead  At the rate it is going  perhaps my current funds are more than sufficient to handle the transactions here  Despite of this  I will still like to make a few suggestions on how to improve the current system  Scrap the auto bidding system This is a cut throat world and to be honest  auto bidding system is not useful and will not be helpful for users who are actually actively waiting for the chance to bid on the loan  It rewards the passive and block out the chances for the active users  Not very healthy for the active bidders  Instill a  minutes queuing system  Instead of having an instant reaction bidding that will jam up the system  A  minute queuing system could be implemented  A person can login  minutes before the actual loan closing and make a bid  The successful bid come in first come first serve format so when the system open up the loan and close  the update can happen without lagging the bidding  For your consideration  p s  The FS still lagging at this instant as I am typing the post  I am not angry  just a little disappointed that I could not get loans due despite of my active actions and system went down  \n",

      "at_user Look at the long term trends of their current account deficit  url Unlike SG and MY which both have a surplus  there will always be pressure on the IDR to depreciate against all currencies  Structural reasons will prevent a surplus anytime soon  So if any non Indonesians plan to invest in IDR investments  you must look at it long term or hedge your fx risk  In the short medium term  my investments in IDR are less than half if I calculate my returns back to SGD  I assume it will worsen since the USD are raising their rates \n",

      "at_user said in  Re  Payment Behavior  MBBT  Borrower ID  post  at_user  not too sure whether you re referring to secured or non subordinated loans  I personally am concerned here as an investor because this loan is an unsecured loan or subordinated loans  I ve asked multiple times to the platform but nobody answered me thus far  hence deem it as subordinated loans  Basically you do not have anything on hand in case of non repayment which translates to loss of investor s principal  Even if the platform opts for legal actions and so forth against the guarantor  it will take loong time and still risking the principal  If you are saying  months as default  in my personal opinion probably you are referring to secured loans where the banks actually hold certain securities in case of non repayment  Correct me if I am wrong \n",
